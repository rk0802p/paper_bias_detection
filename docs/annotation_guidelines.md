# Annotation Guidelines for Academic Bias

This document outlines the procedure and definitions for annotating bias in academic papers. 

## General Instructions

- Read each sentence carefully.
- Assign a bias label if and only if there is clear evidence for it.
- When in doubt, mark as 'No Bias'.

## Bias Categories

### 1. Selection Bias
- **Definition**: Systematic error in choosing participants or data for a study, leading to a sample that is not representative of the population.
- **Example**: A study on the effects of a new drug only includes healthy young adults, excluding older adults or those with chronic illnesses.
- **Annotation**: Mark sentences describing the study's sample selection if it appears skewed.

### 2. Funding Bias (or Sponsorship Bias)
- **Definition**: The tendency of a study's outcome to support the interests of the study's financial sponsor.
- **Example**: A study funded by a sugar company concludes that sugar consumption has no link to obesity.
- **Annotation**: Mark sentences disclosing funding sources if the study's conclusion aligns suspiciously with the sponsor's interests.

### 3. Publication Bias
- **Definition**: The tendency for studies with positive results to be published more frequently than those with negative or null results.
- **Example**: A paper mentions that previous studies with negative results were not published.
- **Annotation**: Mark sentences that discuss the publication status of related studies, especially if they suggest a bias towards positive findings.

### 4. Cognitive Bias
- **Definition**: Errors in thinking that affect the interpretation of data, such as confirmation bias (favoring information that confirms pre-existing beliefs).
- **Example**: An author dismisses evidence that contradicts their hypothesis while overemphasizing confirming evidence.
- **Annotation**: Mark sentences where the author's interpretation of results appears to be skewed by personal beliefs.

## Annotation Format

For each sentence, you will provide a label from the following set: `[Selection Bias, Funding Bias, Publication Bias, Cognitive Bias, No Bias]`.
